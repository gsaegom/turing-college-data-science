# Pig Latin (http://mng.bz/YrON) is a common children's "secret" language in English-speaking countries. (It's
# normally secret among children who forget that their parents were once children themselves.) The rules for
# translating words from English into Pig Latin are quite simple:
#
# If the word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), add "way" to the end of the word. So "air" becomes "airway" and
# "eat" becomes "eatway."
#
# If the word begins with any other letter, then we take the first letter, put it on the end of the word,
# and then add "ay." Thus, "python" becomes "ythonpay" and "computer" becomes "omputercay."
#
# (And yes, I recognize that the rules can be made more sophisticated. Let's keep it simple for the purposes of this
# exercise.)
#
# For this exercise, write a Python function (pig_latin) that takes a string as input, assumed to be an English word.
# The function should return the translation of this word into Pig Latin. You may assume that the word contains no
# capital letters or punctuation.
#
# This exercise isn't meant to help you translate documents into Pig Latin for your job. (If that is your job,
# then I really have to question your career choices.) However, it demonstrates some of the powerful techniques that
# you should know when working with sequences, including searches, iteration, and slices. It's hard to imagine a
# Python program that doesn't include any of these techniques.
